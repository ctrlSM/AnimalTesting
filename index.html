  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <h3>What is Animal Testing?</h3>
  <p>An estimated 26 million animals are used every year in the United States for scientific and commercial testing. The term “animal testing” refers to procedures performed on living animals for purposes of research into basic biology and diseases, assessing the effectiveness of new medicinal products, and testing the human health and/or environmental safety of consumer and industry products such as cosmetics, household cleaners, food additives and pharmaceuticals.</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Proponents of animal testing say that it has enabled the development of many life-saving treatments for both humans and animals.</li>
  <li>Opponents of animal testing say that it is cruel and inhumane to experiment on animals, that alternative methods available to researchers can replace animal testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common animal procedures:</h3>
<p>Most animals are killed at the end of an experiment, but some may be reused in the following experiments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Killing by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, neck-breaking, decapitation, or other means.
</li>
  <li>Forced chemical exposure in toxicity testing, which can include oral force-feeding, forced inhalation, skin or injection into the abdomen, muscles, etc.</li>
  <li>Exposure to drugs, chemicals or infectious disease at levels that cause illness, pain and distress, or death.
</li>
  <li>Food and water deprivation.</li>
  <li>Infliction of wounds, burns and other injuries to study healing.</li>
  <li>Infliction of pain to study its physiology and treatment.</li>
  <li>Behavioural experiments designed to cause distress, e.g., electric shock or forced swimming.</li>
</ul>  
<h3>What types of animals are typically used?</h3>
<p>Many different types of species are used around the world but, the most common include mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, cats, dogs, farm animals, 
  <br> and in some countries monkeys and chimpanzees as well.<br><br>

<div id="PROS" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>PROS</h2>
    <h3>Pro #1</h3>
    <p><b>Animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments.</b>  Nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. Experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. The polio vaccine, tested on animals, reduced the global occurrence of the disease from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 27 cases in 2016. Animal research has also contributed to major advances in understanding and treating conditions such as breast cancer, brain injury, childhood leukemia, cystic fibrosis, malaria and many more.
</p>
  
  
    <h3>Pro #2</h3>
    <p><b>Animals are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.</b> Chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA with humans, and mice are 98% genetically similar to humans. All mammals, including humans, are descended from common ancestors, and all have the same set of organs such as the heart, kidneys, lungs, etc. that function in the same way with the help of a bloodstream and central nervous system. 
</p>

  
    <h3>Pro #3</h3>
    <p><b>Animals often make better research subjects than human beings because of their shorter life cycles.</b> Laboratory mice, for example, live for only two to three years, so researchers can study the effects of treatments or genetic manipulation over a whole lifespan, or across several generations.</p>

</div>

<div id="CONS" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>CONS</h2>
    <h3>Con #1</h3>
    <p><b>Animal testing is cruel and inhumane.</b> According to Humane Society International, animals used in experiments are commonly subjected to force feeding, forced inhalation, food and water deprivation, prolonged periods of physical restraint, the infliction of pain to study its effects and remedies, and "killing by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, neck-breaking, decapitation, or other means."
</p>
  
  <div class="Con #2">
    <h3>Con #2</h3>
    <p><b>Alternative testing methods now exist that can replace the need for animals.</b> Computer models, such as virtual reconstructions of human molecular structures therefore experiments on animals won't be necessary.
</p>
  
  <div class="Con #3">
    <h3>Con #3</h3>
    <p><b>Animals are very different from human beings and therefore make poor test subjects.</b> The anatomic, metabolic, and cellular differences between animals and people make animals poor models for human beings.Laboratory mice, for example, live for only two to three years, so researchers can study the effects of treatments or genetic manipulation over a whole lifespan, or across several generations.</p>

  
   <div class="Con #4">
    <h3>Con #4</h3>
    <p><b>Animal tests are more expensive than alternative methods and are a waste of government research dollars.</b></p>

<div id="NOW" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>NOW</h2>
  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Buy Cruelty-Free Cosmetics instead.</li>
  <li>Educate others about the topic.</li>
  <li>Donate to help animals suffering in labs and other cruel situations.</li>
</ul>  

<h2>More Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>500,000 ANIMALS Suffer and die worldwide every year in cosmetics tests.</li>
  <li>250+ COMPANIES have endorsed the Humane Cosmetics Act, a bill that would end unnecessary cosmetics animal testing in the United States.</li>
  <li>38 COUNTRIES Have full or partial bans on cosmetics animal testing, including all European Union countries, Norway, India, New Zealand, Israel and South Korea.</li>
